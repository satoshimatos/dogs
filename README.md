# Dogs
A simple project I made using no frameworks whatsoever, with pure php, html, css, and js, which connects to an external dogs api (https://dog.ceo/dog-api/).

# How to run
- Clone it and go to your apache browser and run /cli/index.phtml.

# Notes
- No framework was used, therefore I am aware of the ugliness of the code itself.
- I decided to start with the backend development using php, but once I got to the frontend integration I noticed I should have used javascript/ajax from the very beginning, as php works best with internal routes. I didn't want to go back on it and decided to set it as a challenge to make it work. It does work, but it is not very pretty :)
- If I used frameworks it would have been infinitely easier, but the challenged lies within not doing so :)
- Some of the features are experimentations for learning purposes.
